***** Folder Structure of this APP *****
client: The source code for the client code will be kept here.
        Then using gulp tasks the optimized code will be put in the public folder.
config: App-wide configuration settings go here. Example: database credential management, app environment (dev, test, prod), etc.
controllers: The routes, logic for the app and database access goes here.
doc: Add supporting documents for the app.
models: The Schema design for the data goes here. There's a file for each model.
public: Everything that can be served to the client goes here. For example, optimized client code, assets, etc.
client/views: The Pug views for creating the HTML for the app goes here.


***** Long-Term Development *****
- Create API (text only) [Done]
- Create API Spec
- Start front end and deploy. Deliver something.
- Start backend interface.
- Handle Authentication (Use Passport.js)
- Handle File Uploads (Use busboy)
- Add Testing (for practice. Use Karma/Jasmine)


***** Tech Stack *****
Front-End:
    - Webpack: for module loading, bundling and optimizing
    - npm: for package management
    - ?: looking for a nice styling framework. preferably based on material and similar to bootstrap
    - ?: Front-End javaScript framework. Probably Angular, but could be AngularJS because I'm used to that but vue.js and React.js are also good candidates.
