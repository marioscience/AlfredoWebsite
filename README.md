# AlfredoWebsite
Website for musician Alfredo Balcacer. The website consists of a frontend with content and a backend to manage the data displayed in the site.

To see it in action run the project by using nodejs and angular's own development server.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This website is not published as the project ultimately took another direction. The repository is made public to showcase my efforts on it.
